# cheapforum
A forum software written in PHP and sqlite in collaboration with my friend over discord. It features a post system, including a system to upload an image, and a simple page allowing admin to delete a post, as long as they enter a correct password. It was inspired by the old school forum softwares of the late 2000's and early 2010's.
